General anesthesia was administered without complication. The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.\n\nStandard anterolateral and anteromedial portals were established. Diagnostic arthroscopy revealed a complex tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. Additionally, grade II chondromalacia of the medial femoral condyle was noted. The lateral meniscus, ACL, PCL, and remaining articular surfaces appeared intact.\n\nUsing arthroscopic instruments, the unstable portions of the torn medial meniscus were resected back to a stable rim. Care was taken to preserve as much functional meniscal tissue as possible. The knee was thoroughly irrigated.\n\nThe portals were closed with 4-0 nylon sutures. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.\n\nPOST-OPERATIVE PLAN:\n1. Weight-bearing as tolerated with crutches for support initially\n2. Physical therapy to begin 3-5 days postoperatively\n3. Follow-up appointment in 2 weeks for suture removal and progress assessment"
